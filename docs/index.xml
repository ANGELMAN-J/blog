      <description>This is an example of a jupyter notebook to give you an idea of how your blog post could look like.
Python Analysis I # %load std_ipython_import.txt import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns import pymc3 as pm  Model # Using the Theano @as_op decorator with a custom function to calculate the threshold probabilities. # Theano cannot compute a gradient for these custom functions, so it is not possible to use # gradient based samplers in PyMC3.</description>

      <description>Students are in the focus of our teaching. We want to enable them to be able to understand the basic concepts, to learn acquiring knowledge independently and, as following, implement it adequately within a given context. Based on these requirements the content and didactic components of our teaching are established. Our teaching offer is mainly based on the main research focus of the department in order to provide teaching grounded on recent academic developments.</description>
