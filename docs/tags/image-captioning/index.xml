      <description>Introduction Image captioning aims for automatically generating a text that describes the present picture. In the last years it became a topic with growing interest in machine learning and the advances in this field lead to models that (depending on which evaluation) can score even higher than humans do. Image captioning can for instance help visually impaired people to grasp what is happening in a picture. Furthermore, it could enhance the image search of search engines, it could simplify SEO by automatically generating descriptions for the pictures or improve online marketing and customer segmentation by identifying customer interests through interpreting their shared images via social media platforms.</description>
