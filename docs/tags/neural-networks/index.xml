      <description>Neural Network Fundamentals Authors: Mahdi Bayat, Denis Augusto Pinto Maciel, Roman Proskalovich This blog post is a guide to help readers build a neural network from the very basics. It starts with an introduction to the concept of a neural networks concept and its early development. A step-by-step coding tutorial follows, through which relevant concepts are illustrated. Later in the post, there is also an introduction on how to build neural networks in Keras.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks into Production Authors: Mahdi Bayat, Denis Augusto Pinto Maciel, Roman Proskalovich Motivation Training and tuning machine learning model is a hard task. There are many variables involved that can make or break your results. However, also very important is, after fine tuning your model, to be able to deploy it, so it can be accessed by other researchers, developers and applications.
A very common way to accomplish that is by using an API.</description>

A Gentle Introduction to Neural Network Fundamentals 
Imagine the following problem: There are handwritten numbers that you want computer to correctly clasify. It would be an easy task for a person but an extremely complicated one for a machine, especially, if you want to use some traditional prediction model, like linear regression. Even though the computer is faster than the human brain in numeric computations, the brain far outperforms the computer in some tasks.</description>
