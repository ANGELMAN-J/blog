      <description>A Gentle Introduction to Neural Network Fundamentals 
Imagine the following problem: There are handwritten numbers that you want computer to correctly clasify. It would be an easy task for a person but an extremely complicated one for a machine, especially, if you want to use some traditional prediction model, like linear regression. Even though the computer is faster than the human brain in numeric computations, the brain far outperforms the computer in some tasks.</description>

      <description>This is an example of a jupyter notebook to give you an idea of how your blog post could look like.
Python Analysis I # %load std_ipython_import.txt import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns import pymc3 as pm  Model # Using the Theano @as_op decorator with a custom function to calculate the threshold probabilities. # Theano cannot compute a gradient for these custom functions, so it is not possible to use # gradient based samplers in PyMC3.</description>
